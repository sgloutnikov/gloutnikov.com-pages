      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post will go over how to embed the Git commit hash inside a Go binary in order to support a &lt;code&gt;/versionz&lt;/code&gt; endpoint. A &lt;code&gt;/versionz&lt;/code&gt; could include multiple things, including manually defined version numbers, but another nice to have is the Git commit hash which produced the binary of the running software.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had heard before that Go dominates as the programming language of the cloud and wanted to investigate that claim. In this post I looked at the repositories of all Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) projects and assembled statistics on the programming languages used.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>GraphQL Subscriptions with Go (gqlgen) Example</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;GraphQL subscriptions are extremely useful in situations when a server needs to update its clients. A chat application is a great example to demonstrate this, as when new messages arrive we want to distribute them among all chat participants as quickly as possible without polling. When I first started looking at implementing GraphQL subscriptions in Go it took me a bit before I had my aha moment and everything clicked together. Also, at that time there were not a whole lot of examples that I could look at or reference. This post will go over a concrete chat application example using GraphQL subscriptions and a backend built in Go with gqlgen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
