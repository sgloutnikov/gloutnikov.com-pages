      <description>&lt;p&gt;A while back I needed to identify time windows within a time series dataset which led me to discover some interesting SQL functions I was not aware of. In short, what I refer to as a window is a start and end timestamp during which certain defined conditions were true. This post will explore a bit more of the problem definition and go over an example SQL query to tackle it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
