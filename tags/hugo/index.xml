      <description>First post from Hugo&amp;ndash;the fast and modern static website engine.
I quickly become a fan of statically generated sites after seeing Jekyll a few years ago. After getting tired of WordPress, it was on my radar to update my site to a statically generated one, and learn something new at the same time. I was not a fan of the installation dependencies I had to manage with Jekyll, but yesterday I stumbled upon a HN post about Hugo.</description>
