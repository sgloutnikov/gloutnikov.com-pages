      <description>&lt;p&gt;After having worked with GWT several years ago and really liking the framework, I recently found myself trying out Vaadin for a hobby application I want to develop. Vaadin and GWT have their similarities and differences. One of the differences is that Vaadin runs its application logic on the server side, unlike GWT which runs on the client side. This calls for some little extra setup required in the IDE in order to run the application and be able to instantly see UI changes in your browser while developing, without having to restart the application server every time. As a total newbie in Vaadin, I found it a little frustrating that there were no simple instructions on how to achieve this or how it worked. After some digging, I did find a Vaadin blog &lt;a href=&#34;https://vaadin.com/blog/-/blogs/getting-started-with-vaadin-development-using-eclipse-maven&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; that was probably the most helpful, but it only focused on using Eclipse.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
