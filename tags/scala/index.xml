      <description>&lt;p&gt;When performing my analysis and graphing for my previous &lt;a href=&#34;https://gloutnikov.com/post/sxm-theheat-analysis/&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; I ran into a problem of identifying and displaying missing time series data. From a series of data that occurs daily, I wanted to identify if there were missing days, and to graph them so that they can easily be seen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My SiriusXM tracker for &amp;lsquo;The Heat&amp;rsquo; radio station has now been running since the summer of 2016 and has collected a good amount of data. It seemed like a great opportunity to make use of this data for getting some insight into what songs/artists/albums have been popular throughout the months, and also get some Spark practice under my belt.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Using Apache Spark with MongoDB</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This example will go over setting up a simple Scala project in which we will access a Mongo Database and perform read/write operations. In order to access MongoDB from spark we will need the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mongodb.com/products/spark-connector&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;MongoDB Connector for Spark&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
