      <title>Integration Tests with External Dependencies in Go</title>
      <link>https://gloutnikov.com/post/integration_tests_with_external_dependencies/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Integration tests are tests which use or depend on some external software like a database, cache layer, or any service. While unit tests validate smaller pieces of software logic, it is always good to also run integration tests in an as-close-as-possible to real environment, and preferably also have them automated. This post will go over a way to easily include and automate the use of external dependencies in your integration tests and CI/CD environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Replacing Docker Desktop with Colima</title>
      <link>https://gloutnikov.com/post/replacing_docker_desktop_with-colima/</link>

      <guid>https://gloutnikov.com/post/replacing_docker_desktop_with-colima/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recent license changes to Docker Desktop meant that large companies would need a license to use it. I spent some time looking for a suitable alternative to Docker Desktop on MacOS, and until recently, that was running and ssh-ing into a Linux Virtual Machine. I stumbled upon the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/lima-vm/lima&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;lima&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/abiosoft/colima&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;colima&lt;/a&gt; projects, with the latter bringing container runtimes on macOS, and this is what I am using going forward. This post will go over installing and using &lt;code&gt;colima&lt;/code&gt; to replace Docker Desktop on your MacOS (and Linux) machine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Embedding Git commit hash in a Go binary</title>

      <guid>https://gloutnikov.com/post/embedding_git_hash_in_go_binary/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post will go over how to embed the Git commit hash inside a Go binary in order to support a &lt;code&gt;/versionz&lt;/code&gt; endpoint. A &lt;code&gt;/versionz&lt;/code&gt; could include multiple things, including manually defined version numbers, but another nice to have is the Git commit hash which produced the binary of the running software.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had heard before that Go dominates as the programming language of the cloud and wanted to investigate that claim. In this post I looked at the repositories of all Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) projects and assembled statistics on the programming languages used.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Quick docker container shell alias</title>

      <guid>https://gloutnikov.com/post/docker-container-shell-alias/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Often we need to run shell commands on a running docker container. The traditional way would be to run &lt;code&gt;docker exec -it &amp;lt;container&amp;gt; /bin/bash&lt;/code&gt; for example. Below is an alias to simplify this process a bit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some Kubernetes resources require elevated privileges to access. For example, passing &lt;code&gt;--as &amp;lt;namespace&amp;gt;-admin&lt;/code&gt; to each &lt;code&gt;kubectl&lt;/code&gt; command. Below is a convenient alias to elevate your permissions for such resources.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are like me, you may have an old, but still perfectly functioning printer which you would like to print on from anywhere in your house. In my case, I even kept an old Windows PC just for printing. That PC is soon going to recycling, now that a Raspberry Pi helped make the printer reachable from any computer, phone, or tablet on the home network. This post will show how to easily achieve this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Apache Pulsar is a distributed pub-sub messaging system that I have recently enjoyed testing for some projects of mine. It has grown very much on me and am now preferring it over Apache Kafka. In this post we will go over installing and getting started with an Apache Pulsar instance running on Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Time Series Session Window(s) SQL Query</title>

      <guid>https://gloutnikov.com/post/time-series-windows-sql-query/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A while back I needed to identify time windows within a time series dataset which led me to discover some interesting SQL functions I was not aware of. In short, what I refer to as a window is a start and end timestamp during which certain defined conditions were true. This post will explore a bit more of the problem definition and go over an example SQL query to tackle it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>GraphQL Subscriptions with Go (gqlgen) Example</title>
      <link>https://gloutnikov.com/post/graphql-subscriptions-go-gqlgen-example/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 28 Mar 2021 14:08:22 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://gloutnikov.com/post/graphql-subscriptions-go-gqlgen-example/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;GraphQL subscriptions are extremely useful in situations when a server needs to update its clients. A chat application is a great example to demonstrate this, as when new messages arrive we want to distribute them among all chat participants as quickly as possible without polling. When I first started looking at implementing GraphQL subscriptions in Go it took me a bit before I had my aha moment and everything clicked together. Also, at that time there were not a whole lot of examples that I could look at or reference. This post will go over a concrete chat application example using GraphQL subscriptions and a backend built in Go with gqlgen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My SiriusXM tracker for &amp;lsquo;The Heat&amp;rsquo; radio station has now been running since the summer of 2016 and has collected a good amount of data. It seemed like a great opportunity to make use of this data for getting some insight into what songs/artists/albums have been popular throughout the months, and also get some Spark practice under my belt.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>After having worked with GWT several years ago and really liking the framework, I recently found myself trying out Vaadin for a hobby application I want to develop. Vaadin and GWT have their similarities and differences. One of the differences is that Vaadin runs its application logic on the server side, unlike GWT which runs on the client side. This calls for some little extra setup required in the IDE in order to run the application and be able to instantly see UI changes in your browser while developing, without having to restart the application server every time.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After hosting a few of my apps on Heroku I quickly became a fan of the platform, and saw why it gets such high praise. The ease of deploying an application straight through Git is amazing. Not having to worry about managing servers, or managing the environment is perfect&amp;ndash;it allows a developer to go straight into developing and deploying their apps with minimal hassle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>There are a few SiriusXM stations that I always listened to in my car. With Hip-Hop being one of my favorite genres, The Heat was one of my favorite stations. I liked that they play new and old songs, and I would always pick up on some new song that is beginning to trend. After moving to Bulgaria I lost this ability, and I could not justify paying more for online radio than Spotify.</description>

      <description>I was born in the town of Gabrovo, located in north-central Bulgaria, where I lived throughout my early childhood before my family moved to the United States. I received a B.S. and a M.S. in Computer Science from San José State University. The areas that I am most passionate about are in distributed systems, anything related to working with data, information security, and machine learning. I’m a big sports fan, and watch a fair bit of TV series&amp;ndash;probably more than I should.</description>

      <description>First post from Hugo&amp;ndash;the fast and modern static website engine.
I quickly become a fan of statically generated sites after seeing Jekyll a few years ago. After getting tired of WordPress, it was on my radar to update my site to a statically generated one, and learn something new at the same time. I was not a fan of the installation dependencies I had to manage with Jekyll, but yesterday I stumbled upon a HN post about Hugo.</description>
