      <description>I was born in the town of Gabrovo, located in north-central Bulgaria, where I lived throughout my early childhood before my family moved to the United States. I received a B.S. and a M.S. in Computer Science from San José State University. The areas that I am most passionate about are in distributed systems, anything related to working with data, information security, and machine learning. I’m a big sports fan, and watch a fair bit of TV series&amp;ndash;probably more than I should.</description>
